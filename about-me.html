    <h1>About Me</h1></div>

    <p>I was born in the North-East Corner of Kansas. Grew up in a tiny farm-town called Goff,KS. Raised on a small cattle farm, my father built up when he move his growing family out into the country. When I turned the age of 16, I started working in a farm equipment factory till I was 18 years old. I then pack my bags for the East coast and landed in Boston, MA. There, I started my own window and gutter cleaning business. Got tired of the congested city life at the age of 24, sold my business and took off for this wonderful state of Colorado, and settled in. Here in Colorado, I work a 40 hour work week, as a foreman to a construction company, all while putting my self through web developement to progress my future and hopefully grasp everything and eventually move to AI programming.
